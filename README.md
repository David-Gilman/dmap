# Disaster Map
This is a proof of concept completed as an entry for the Hack Texas 2017 hackathon.
It uses the tweepy python library to pull Twitter data, jquery, and the Google Maps API, all running on Flask.
It allows a user to query a geographic area and get a heat map of all the disaster related keywords in an area.
